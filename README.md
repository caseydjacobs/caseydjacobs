I am an Aerospace Engineering student with a particular interest in race car aerodynamics. I am also the Aerodynamics Team Lead for Cyclone Racing Formula SAE. In my spare time, or rather my spare time that isn't spent on the formula car, I race whatever kart or car I can get my hands on and play pool.
